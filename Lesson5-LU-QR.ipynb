    "### LU Decomposition\n",
    "\n",
    "In numerical analysis and linear algebra, LU decomposition is used to factor a matrix into two matrices $\\textbf{L}$ and $\\textbf{U}$ which are lower triangular and upper triangluar matrices respectively. \n",
    "\n",
    "It helps in the following :-\n",
    "\n",
    "- Solving a system of linear equations through Gaussian elimination\n",
    "- Finding inverse of a matrix\n",
    "- Computing the determinant of a matrix\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\textbf{A} = \\textbf{L}\\textbf{U}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\begin{bmatrix} a_{11} & a_{12} & a_{13} \\\\  a_{21} & a_{22} & a_{23} \\\\  a_{31} & a_{32} & a_{33} \\end{bmatrix}  = \\begin{bmatrix} l_{11} & 0 & 0 \\\\  l_{21} & l_{22} & 0 \\\\  l_{31} & a_{32} & a_{33} \\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix} u_{11} & u_{12} & u_{13} \\\\  u_{21} & u_{22} & 0 \\\\  u_{31} & 0 & 0 \\end{bmatrix}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "**What is the use of LU decomposition ?**\n",
    "\n",
    "It summerises the Gaussian elimination in matrix form.\n",
    "\n",
    "**What are the conditions for LU decomposition to exist ?**\n",
    "\n",
    "- A should be a square matrix \n",
    "- Permuation matrix should be 0\n",
    "\n",
    "Exapanding on the last point, it is not always possible to decompose the matrix into a lower triangular and upper triangular matrix, say if $a_{11}=0$ in original matrix then either $u_{11}$ or $l_{11}$ has to be 0. This means that either $\\textbf{L}$ or $\\textbf{U}$ should be non-invertible (All 0's in one row). However, this is not possible as  $\\textbf{A}$ is invertible. This problem can be solved by just reordering the rows of $\\textbf{A}$ so that the first element of permuted matrix is not 0."
