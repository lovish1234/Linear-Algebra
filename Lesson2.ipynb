    "One common approach in mathematics is to construct a set of objects and define rules to maniuplate these objects. This is known as algebra. \n",
    "\n",
    "One such approach is known as linear algebra. Basically, linear algebra is the study of vectors. During early introduction  to vectors in high school years, we were introduced to them through physics classes having fourmulas such as  $ \\hspace{0.1in} \\vec{f} = m.\\vec{a}$. Back then, we imagined vectors as a scalar which also has a direction. We understood them through a geometric interpretation with an arrow. The length of the arrow dentote the magnitude and the head of the arrow pointed towards the direction of the vector.\n",
    "\n",
    "Moving on to the fresher/sophomore year in university, we were introduced to vectors as an abstract concept. \n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, for people who have pursued degrees in engineering disciplines, vector appeared in another avatar $\\mathbb{R}^{n}$ or a list of n numbers. These list of number often represent some \"data\" which needs to be analyzed. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this course, we would refresh all of these interpretations and try to connect them in a coherent manner. We would use the \"school\" interpretation of vectors to help visualize and understand \"university-fresher\" and \"engineer\" representation. Another point to be noted is that this course is bit leaning towards the \"university-fresher\" representation of the matrix as it forms basis of linear algebra. Some resources pertaining other interpretations are listed below in this document."
